# Libellula Aircraft Sizing Repository

More detailed information describing this codebase can be found in section 16 of the CDR, in /.Reports/

This repository contains the packages we used to size our aircraft, the Libellula F-481, for the AIAA 2025 Aircraft Design Competition and University of Michigan Aerospace Engineering Design capstone class, AEROSP 481.. 

The design RFP can be found in Documentation/Class Resources.

To use, run sizing.m. Sizing.m outputs relevant graphs corresponding to input parameters, which come from files beginning with "generate_", most of which are in /AircraftSpecs/.
